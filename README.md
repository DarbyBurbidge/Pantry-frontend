# Frontend for the Pantry app. 
Built in React, the app allows users to login and add items to their pantry

### The main page is a simple organizer that allows one to sort items by tags
Each item has a name, quantity, expiration, tags, and toggleable "favorite" attribute
This allows users to easily open the app and check what they have at home while they are out shopping.

### The app also allows a user to create a shopping list.
The list allows a user to add items to the list, similar to the main pantry page, but also allows a user to then migrate the items from the list into their pantry after their shopping is done.

### Unfinished features:
* Favorite toggle doesn't have a function -> Should automatically add to the shopping list, as well as be at the top of the sorting algorithms
* Editing items can be a bit clunky sometimes (removing an items expiration)
* Header pops oddly on loading
