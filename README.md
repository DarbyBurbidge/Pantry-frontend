# Frontend for Easy Pantry app. 
Built in React, the app allows users to login and add items to their pantry. Built with a mobile first design, the layout is simple and easy to parse.

### The main page is a simple organizer that allows one to sort items by tags
Each item has a name, quantity, expiration, tags, and toggleable "favorite" attribute
This allows users to easily open the app and check what they have at home while they are out shopping.

### The app also allows a user to create a shopping list.
The list allows a user to add items to the list, similar to the main pantry page, but also allows migration of the items from the list into their pantry after their shopping is done. Favorite items are automatically added to the shopping list to make generating a list for regular shopping easy.

### Design choices
* Color pallette was chosen to be gentle on the eyes, but still clearly legible. 
* The same design philosphy is why the forms and buttons are rounded and bubbly. I wanted something reminiscent of kitchen timers.
* Minimal animations means less delay between choosing to do something and doing it.


### Planned features
* Better accessibility
* Dark Mode
* Port to react-native as a proper app
